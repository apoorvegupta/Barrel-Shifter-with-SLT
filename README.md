# Barrel-Shifter-with-SLT
A barrel shifter is simply a bit-rotating shift register. The bits shifted out the MSB end of the register are shifted back into the LSB end of the register. In a barrel shifter, the bits are shifted the desired number of bit positions in a single clock cycle. For example, an eight-bit barrel shifter could shift the data by three positions in a single clock cycle. If the original data was 11110000, one clock cycle later the result will be 10000111.  Several microprocessors include barrel-shifters as part of their ALUs to provide fast shift or rotate open.
